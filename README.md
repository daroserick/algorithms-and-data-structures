# Logic, Algorithms and Data Structures Exercises

This repository contains my ongoing practice of programming logic, algorithms, and data structures. The goal is to sharpen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical challenges.

## Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| [Fundamentals](./fundamentals) | Basic programming logic exercises (conditions, loops, basic operations) |
| [Data Structures](./data-structures) | Exercises involving stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc. |
| [Algorithms](./algorithms) | Sorting, searching, recursion, and dynamic programming algorithms |
| [Challenges](./challenges) | Challenges from platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, and others |

## Organization

- Each folder or file represents a specific set of exercises or topics. 
- Solutions may be written in different languages, such as Python, C, JavaScript, among others.

## Topics covered

- Conditionals and looping structures
- Arrays and matrices
- Recursion
- Data structures (lists, queues, stacks, trees, graphs)
- Sorting and searching algorithms
- Dynamic programming
- Classic algorithm problems

## How to view
